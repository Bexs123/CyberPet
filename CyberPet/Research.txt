I did some research on window setInterval() method and Window setTimeOut() method, has apart of the cyber pet project, because we needed
to know which method we could included in the project and by doing the research we found why we could only use that method within our project.

Window setInterval() method

The setInterval() method call a function or evaluates an expression at specified setIntervals (in milliseconds).

The setInterval() method will continue calling the function until clearInterval() is called or windows is closed.

The ID value returned by setInterval() is used as the parameter for the clearInterval() method.

TIP 1000ms = 1second.

TIP To execute a function only once, after a specified number of milliseconds, use the setTimeOut() method.



clearInterval()

The clearInterval() method clears a timer set with the setInterval() method.

Note: To be able to use the clearInterval() method you must use a variable when creating the interval method.



Window setTimeOut() method

setTimeOut(function() {alert ("Hello); }, 3000);

The setTimeOut() method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified numberof milliseconds.

Tip: The function is only executed once. If you need to repeat execution, use the setInterval() method.

Tip: Use the clearTimeOut() method to prevent the function from running.
